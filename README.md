We as a group realize that teamwork is of the utmost importance. Frustration and aggression will be ineffective and worthless, and therefore we will all strive to communicate thoroughly and efficiently. If conflict arises, we will attempt to settle the dispute maturely, and with no lingering bitterness towards one another. Through this focus on communication, the team will be able to efficiently break down problems and produce excellent results.
We agree to communicate primarily through Slack, with our backups being Text or Email, using Teams for calls. We agree to put our full effort forward in this class- An 'A' is our collective end goal, and we are prepared to put the effort in required to accomplish this. Working together and trying to balance our collective workload is our primary goal for this semester. 
When it comes to decision concerning the project, we as a group think that the majority rule should be followed. With that being said, we are willing to hear the other side and try to compromise but if a compromised cannot be found the majority vote wins. Team meetings will occur at least once for every assignment either on teams or slack but no in person meetings will be made mandatory nor would they be made frequent.
